# NN-LIB

## Implementation of Neural Network from Scratch.The plan(still is) was to make GPU accelerated NeuralNet Library..but until time being...here's what i could cook

### Layers:-
Linear

Sigmoid

Relu

### Optimizers:-
SGD

### Loss Function:-
SoftmaxLoss


### Utilities:-
Plot functions to show result.

### Dataset:-
Spiral

Circle(soon)

You can also try a Custom one :)


Run Test.py for a code run...

Will add theory later..
