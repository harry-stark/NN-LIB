# NN-LIB

## Implementation of Neural Network from Scratch.The plan(still is) was to make a GPU accelerated NeuralNet Library..but until time being...here's what i could cook :sweat_smile:

### Layers:-
Linear

Sigmoid

Relu

### Optimizers:-
SGD

### Loss Function:-
SoftmaxLoss


### Utilities:-
Plot functions to show result.

### Dataset:-
Spiral

Circle(soon)

You can also try a Custom one :)

## Give it a spin:-
Run Test.py for a code run...

#### Further Add on:-
Will add some theory.
